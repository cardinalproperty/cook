# Overview

Cook is divided into two main parts: The [core](/docs/api/), which is basically
the API of the system, and then the [builtin rules](/docs/rules/). The frontend
API is currently not covered since it might change soon. All in all, the 
documentation is not very good right now (even when ignoring the ugly menu), 
but it should be hopefully improved soon.
