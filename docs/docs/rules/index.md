title: Builtin Rules
---

There are currently **4** builtin rule-sets with one ore more rules each. It is
planned to add more, so that just installing Cook will provide you with a very
extensive set of rules. Currently the API may change on every update. However, when the leaving alpha 
or beta state, it will probably be decided that the API may or may not change
according to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). Since the current
version of Cook is `0.x.y`, it is in conformance with the specification to
break the API whenever it is reasonable to do so.
